1.  stdint defines ints with standard widths of bytes (8, 16, etc)
2.  This determines the size of these ints across all systems, which helps prevent the introduction of bugs caused by different platforms interpreting ints as varying bit sizes
3.  Byte: 8, DWord: 32, LONG: 32, WORD: 16
4.  66, and 77
5.  biSize is the size of the image, whereas bfSize includes the header information as well
6.  That means that the image is top-down
7.  WORD biBitCount; 
8.  a file could either by not opened or not created
9.  We are always only reading in 1 file at a time
10. 1
11. fseek is our file position indicator
12. SEEK_CUR is  where we currently are in the file
